## R CMD check results
There were no NOTEs, ERRORs or WARNINGs.

## Reverse dependencies

Covr is a development tool only so its code is not actually run when building
any downstream dependencies. Nonetheless I have run R CMD check on the 260
downstream dependencies.

The errors in biolink, geofacet, Wmisc are due to `lintr::expect_lint_free()`
not working properly when it is used while running `devtools::revdep_check()`.
I opened issue [#251](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/issues/251) to track
this bug in lintr.

I did not see any other errors that were relevant to the covr changes.
